//what is the difference between the interface and the abstraction
 //interface is the complete 100% abstraction  									 abstaction is partial abstarction()
 //if we wanted to hide all implemention of methods we will go for interface	 some implementation and some abstraction
 //we no need to use the abstarct keyword the inteface							we have to use the abstract keword to define the unimplemented methods
 //the variables declaration in the interface are final 						we can initialise the varibles
 //main method we will not have in interafce									we can have main mwthod also
